            <h2 class="section-title">Who we are</h2>
            <p>We are a group of individuals with high level spinal cord injuries (SCI) who get together on a weekly basis to play a game, using special wheelchairs, that allows us to continue to be competitive athletes despite our injury. Half of our members are former members of the military who served proudly, while the rest of our group is made up of members with diverse backgrounds. Together we share the same common experiences of living a life with an SCI, which just happens to include a love for the game that we play together. We have been gathering at various locations around San Antonio to play wheelchair rugby for more than 20 years. Our desire is to continue to play rugby as long as we can and build our membership so that no one with an SCI will miss the opportunity to play rugby.</p>

            <p>we are a 501(c)(3) organization. Donations are tax deductible. Any monetary support that we receive is used solely for the following needs:</p>
            <div class="">

                <img src="img/equipment.png" alt="" class="donate-img">
                <p class="">rugby wheelchairs range in price from $5k for a basic frame with no wheels to $11k for a custom frame with two sets of wheels. This is the highest barrier to entry into the sport for newly injured athletes as these wheelchairs are not covered by healthcare plans (excluding Veterans benefits).</p>

                <img src="img/travel_2.jpg" alt="" class="donate-img">
                <p class="">given that we are the only wheelchair rugby team in San Antonio and we are members of the USQRA (the national wheelchair rugby league), we must travel to other cities to compete in tournaments with other teams. A single weekend tournament can cost the team $6k for plane flights and lodging for our players.</p>
