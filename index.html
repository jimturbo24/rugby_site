            <h2 class="section-title">Who we are</h2>
            <p>We are a group of individuals with high level spinal cord injuries (SCI) who get together on a weekly basis to play a game, using special wheelchairs, that allows us to continue to be competitive athletes despite our injury. Half of our members are former members of the military who served proudly, while the rest of our group is made up of members with diverse backgrounds. Together we share the same common experiences of living a life with an SCI, which just happens to include a love for the game that we play together. We have been gathering at various locations around San Antonio to play wheelchair rugby for more than 20 years. Our desire is to continue to play rugby as long as we can and build our membership so that no one with an SCI will miss the opportunity to play rugby.</p>

            <p>We endeavor to encourage physical activity and provide community for disabled individuals, promote wheelchair rugby as a sport, provide training in the sport of wheelchair rugby, and solicit financial support to promote the health and welfare of team members through the sport of wheelchair rugby.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">the game we love</h2>
            <p>Wheelchair Rugby is a team sport for disabled athletes, many of whom have experienced a high level spinal cord injury. It combines elements of rugby, basketball and handball to produce a unique and exciting new sport. Players compete in teams of four to carry the ball across the opposing team's goal line. Contact between wheelchairs is permitted, and is in fact an integral part of the sport as players use their chairs to block and hold opponents.</p>

                <p class="">rugby wheelchairs range in price from $5k for a basic frame with no wheels to $11k for a custom frame with two sets of wheels. This is the highest barrier to entry into the sport for newly injured athletes as these wheelchairs are not covered by healthcare plans (excluding Veterans benefits).</p>
